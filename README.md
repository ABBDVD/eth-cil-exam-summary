# Post-exam thoughts

This summary was used by at least six people at the exam. The feedback was largely positive, it seems like it helped. However, it misses information in regard to Vector Algebra & Calculus (primarily how to differentiate) and maybe some proofs. The exam was IMHO heavy on the "Proof property XY" and "Differentiate function XY".
